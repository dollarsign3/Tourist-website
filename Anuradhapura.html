                    <p style="font-size:2vw;">Anuradhapura was the island's first capital, founded in the 4th century BC. Anuradhapura  Sri Lanka's medieval capital is a must-see for anybody visiting the country. This city, situated 205 kilometers north of Colombo, is one of Sri Lanka's eight World Heritage Sites and one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities.</p>

                            <p class="HP">The ruins of Anuradhapura are a popular tourist destination in South Asia, and it was built around a graft from Lord Buddha's Fig Tree, the tree of enlightenment. The Bodhi Tree Temple is one of Anuradhapura's greatest blessed tourist sites, having been maintained for over 23 centuries. 
                                While it is common to see olive trees that are over 2000 years old in Greece or the Middle East, Anuradhapura's Bodhi Tree, which was planted in 288 BC and is protected by a wall and visited by Buddhist pilgrims in large numbers every year, is the world's oldest, adorned with strings of prayer flags meant to bless peace, good fortune, and protection.

                            <h1 class="HH">Ruwanwelisaya</h1>
                            <p class="HP">The Ruwanwelisaya Dagaba is the modern name for the Mahathupa (Great Thupa). The Maha vihara's centerpiece is this (Great Monastery).
                                 The Maha Vihara was Anuradhapura's most prominent monastery, with a long history of safeguarding Theravada Buddhism traditions and monks who looked after the city's most precious shrines.
                                  The exquisite white Ruwanwelisaya Dagaba, defended by a 'wall of elephants,' still looks spectacular, despite not being at its full height and original form. There was a ruby the size of a man's fist on top of this lovely 'bubble' shaped Mahathupa, and today the Burmese people have given a rock crystal that is 2 feet high (60cm) to replace it.</p>

                            <p class="HP">Thuparamaya is Sri Lanka's earliest stupa, built after Buddhism was introduced to the country. The Thuparamaya, erected by King Devanapiyatissa, houses the Buddha's precious collar bone. This relic, a gift from India, attests to the cordial relations between the then-ruler of Sri Lanka and India. The columns that surrounded the stupa were part of a path that supported a covering that sheltered the sacred structure.
                                 The interior of such an architecture must have been a spectacular statement of wooden architecture and the most skilled craftsmanship in terms of aesthetics.</p>

                            <h1 class="HH">Samadhi Buddha statue</h1>
                            <p class="HP">The Samadhi Statue is a Sri Lankan statue located in Mahamevnawa Park in Anuradhapura.
                                 The Buddha is represented in the Dhyana Mudra, a meditation posture linked to his first Enlightenment, also known as Nirvana.
                                  The Buddha sits cross-legged with his uplifted palms placed one over the other on his lap in the Dhyana Mudra. This stance is well-known throughout the Buddhist world, and as a result, this statue is one of the most common Buddhist sculptures.
                                   It should not be mistaken with the very similar "Earth-Touching Mudra," which represents the Buddha's simple action of fending off the illusions projected by Mara, who was anxious to keep the Buddha from discovering that his, Mara's, projections, and with them the entire world, were illusions. 
                                The statue stands 8 feet tall and is made of granite.</p>
